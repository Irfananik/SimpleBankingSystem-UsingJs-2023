# Simple bankig system with JS (Qk Bank)  - 2023

## About this project
This website is a basic banking system created for practicing web development skills rather than practical use. It allows users to perform simple banking operations such as creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and transferring funds between accounts.

The website has been built using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS framework, and JavaScript. The HTML structure provides the foundation for the various pages and elements of the banking system. CSS and Tailwind CSS are used to style the website, giving it a visually appealing and consistent design.

The JavaScript code is responsible for the functionality of the banking system. It handles user interactions, validates inputs, and performs the necessary calculations for account transactions. The website utilizes JavaScript's DOM manipulation to dynamically update the user interface based on user actions.

While the website is responsive to some extent, it is not fully optimized for different screen sizes and devices. This means that it may not display perfectly on all types of devices, but it should still be usable to a certain extent.

I have hosted your website on Netlify, a popular platform for deploying web projects, and have used GitHub for version control, allowing you to push your code and manage your project effectively.

Overall, my simple banking system website serves as a practice project for web development, offering users the ability to simulate basic banking operations and helping you gain experience in building functional websites.
